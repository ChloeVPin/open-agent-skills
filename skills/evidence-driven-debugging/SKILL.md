# Evidence-Driven Debugging

## Purpose and scope

Find and correct the cause of a software failure without confusing a plausible story with evidence. Use this skill for code, tests, builds, deployments, and runtime behavior. It does not replace incident response, security triage, or domain-specific safety procedures.

## Triggers and prerequisites

Trigger when behavior is broken, surprising, flaky, slower than required, or contradicted by a test or specification. Before changing code, collect the exact symptom, expected behavior, reproduction inputs, environment/version, relevant revision, logs or traces, and the narrowest command that demonstrates the problem.

## Decision criteria

- An **observation** is directly reproduced or measured; a **hypothesis** explains it but remains unverified.
- A discriminating experiment changes one relevant variable and produces outcomes that distinguish competing hypotheses.
- A fix is not validated by making one symptom disappear if the root cause, boundary behavior, and regression risk remain unknown.
- Prefer the smallest reversible experiment and the smallest change that explains all observed evidence.

## Procedure

1. State the expected behavior and the actual symptom in observable terms. Record what is known, what is inferred, and what is missing.
2. Reproduce the failure with the smallest reliable input and command. Capture the baseline result before editing. If it is intermittent, characterize frequency and conditions instead of calling it fixed after one successful run.
3. Map the execution path from the failing interface to the relevant state, inputs, dependencies, and side effects. Inspect callers and tests before selecting a change.
4. Generate at least two plausible hypotheses, including one explanation that would make the current theory wrong. Rank them by evidence, not familiarity.
5. Design the smallest discriminating check for the highest-risk hypothesis. Use a focused test, trace, boundary input, controlled configuration change, or source/documentation check. Do not change production code merely to gather an unrecorded guess.
6. Update the hypothesis table from the result: supported, weakened, refuted, or unresolved. Repeat only while the next experiment can change the decision.
7. Implement the narrowest root-cause fix. Avoid suppressing errors, broadening permissions, loosening assertions, adding retries, or changing unrelated behavior unless evidence establishes that as the cause and the tradeoff is explicit.
8. Add or update a regression check for the original symptom and at least one nearby boundary or failure path when practical. Preserve a reproduction for bugs that could recur.
9. Verify in layers: reproduce the original case, run focused regression checks, inspect affected interfaces and side effects, then run broader project checks when warranted.
10. Report the causal evidence, changed behavior, checks run and not run, residual uncertainty, and the condition that should trigger another investigation.

## Examples and counterexamples

Good: A request intermittently hangs. Measure when it happens, isolate the input and dependency state, compare traces for hanging and completing runs, then fix the demonstrated wait condition and retain a timeout/regression case.

Bad: Add a timeout because the request hangs, without determining whether the timeout hides data loss, a deadlock, or a slow but valid operation.

Good: A test fails only on one platform. Reproduce with the platform and version recorded, compare path, locale, filesystem, and dependency assumptions, and change the code only after identifying the platform-specific cause.

Bad: Skip the test or hard-code the observed output because the local platform passes.

## Failure modes and recovery

If the failure cannot be reproduced, preserve the report and add instrumentation or a controlled reproduction before changing behavior. If multiple causes remain plausible, do not choose by intuition; run a discriminating experiment or state the blocker. If the proposed fix changes the symptom but not the causal evidence, revert it and return to hypothesis testing. If the issue may be security-related, stop ordinary debugging and follow the repository’s security disclosure and containment process.

## Validation evidence and provenance
Claims in this skill map to graded findings in [`docs/research.md`](../../docs/research.md):

- Observation/hypothesis/experiment discipline (F4, Principled): operationalized scientific method; not an evaluated intervention.
- Incident discipline — clear roles, preserved facts and follow-ups (C2, Moderate): convergent postmortem practice.
- Motivating evidence (F1, Strong): verification failure modes occur even in successful agent runs; superficial checks miss real failures.

Source boundary: sources are design input, not proof that this debugging procedure outperforms alternatives in a given codebase.

Confidence: high for the general workflow; medium for any individual diagnosis until reproduction and regression evidence exist. Freshness: review when debugging tooling or the research base changes.

Disconfirmation: empirical evidence that hypothesis-table methods provide no diagnostic benefit over intuition-guided debugging at comparable skill levels would require revising the procedure's emphasis.
